# CPP-Python-HelloWorld

This is a glorified Github Gist. I wanted to have a specific template for a Python HTTP server with
a C++ module, but it just says Hello World. Nothing special.

## Installation

This doesn't need to be installed, but it needs to be build by running `make`.

## Running

Run `./main.py`.
